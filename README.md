These environment variables will be defined for you on process.env. For example, having an environment variable
REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE will be exposed in your JS as process.env.REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE

# AuthLayout at 6.26.45
This is a mechanism, using which we protect pages and routes.

* line=> 24-33 explanation-
Imagine you have a game where you can enter two rooms: the "login" room and the "main" room.

Now, let's say you have a special key called "authentication". If you have this key, it means you're allowed to enter the "main" room. If you don't have it, you can only enter the "login" room.

Now, let's break down the code:

1. First Check: It's like checking if you have your special key ("authentication"). If you have it, and the room you're in isn't the "main" room, you'll go to the "main" room.
.If you have the key and you're not already in the "main" room, you'll go to the "main" room.

2. Second Check: If you don't have the special key ("authentication"), and the room you're in isn't the "login" room, you'll go to the "login" room.
.If you don't have the key and you're not already in the "login" room, you'll go to the "login" room.

Set Loader: After you've checked and decided which room to go to, you'll turn off a loading spinner because you've made your decision and you're ready to go.

@line-3 What Controller means?
Alright, let's imagine you have a remote-controlled car. The car can do lots of cool things, like move forward, backward, left, and right. But to control it, you need a remote controller, right? Well, think of the `Controller` in `react-hook-form` like that remote controller.

Here's how it works:

1. Car (Component): Imagine your form fields are like cars. Each car (form field) can do different things, like accepting text, numbers, or checkboxes.

2. Remote Controller (Controller): Now, to control each car (form field), you need something special. That's where the `Controller` comes in. It helps you connect your form fields to your form (the remote controller) so you can control them.

3. Buttons (Props): When you set up the `Controller`, you can tell it what kind of car (form field) it should control. You can also give it some special buttons (props) to customize how it works, like setting rules for what kind of input the car (form field) can accept.

So, in simple terms, the `Controller` in `react-hook-form` is like a remote controller for your form fields. It helps you connect them to your form and customize how they behave.

# Regex 
Alright, imagine you have a secret code that only lets certain people into your super cool club. This secret code is like a pattern, and it's written in a special language that only you and your friends understand. 
This language is called "Regular Expressions" or "Regex" for short.

Now, let's break it down:

1. **Secret Code (Regex)**: This is the pattern you create to match certain text. It's like a recipe for finding specific words or patterns in a bunch of text. For example, if your secret code is "banana," it will look for any word that has the letters "banana" in it.

2. **Special Language (Regex Syntax)**: Just like how you have to write your secret code in a special language, Regex has its own special symbols and rules. These symbols tell the computer exactly what to look for. For example, if you want to find any word that starts with the letter "b," you might use the symbol "b" in your secret code.

3. **Finding Words (Matching Text)**: Once you've written your secret code (Regex pattern), you can use it to search through a bunch of text. When the computer finds a word or pattern that matches your secret code, it's like finding a clue that lets you into your club.

So, in simple terms, Regex is like a secret code written in a special language that helps you find specific words or patterns in text. It's like having a superpower that lets you search through text and find exactly what you're looking for.

# src/components/post-form/PostForm.jsx
line- 62 to 70 code explanation (can be a interview question)
Alright, let's break it down step by step:

1. **What's useEffect?**: Imagine useEffect as a special box in React that you can put stuff into. This box does things for you whenever something changes in your app. It's like a magic box that React gives you to do special tasks.

2. **What's watch?**: Think of watch like a guard watching over something in your app. It keeps an eye on certain things and tells you when they change. So, in this case, watch is keeping an eye on the value of something.

3. **Why do we need subscription.unsubscribe()?**: Well, think of subscription as a ticket to watch something. When you subscribe to something, you're saying, "Hey, I want to watch this!" But when you're done watching, you need to return the ticket, right? That's what unsubscribe does. It's like saying, "Okay, I'm done watching now, you can stop keeping an eye on that for me."

4. **Putting it all together**: So, in our useEffect box, we're telling React to watch something. But if we keep watching forever, it's like having too many guards around, and that's not good for our app's performance. So, when we're done with the useEffect box, we return the ticket (unsubscribe) to stop watching and keep things tidy.

In interviews, when they ask you about this code, you can say, "Oh yeah, we're using useEffect to watch something in our app. But to avoid keeping too many watches running all the time, we return the subscription with unsubscribe when we're done." They'll be impressed by your explanation!
